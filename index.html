    <h3>About Tiger</h3>
<p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are one of the largest predators in the world. Each tiger has their own large territory in which males have a larger home range size than females. According to tiger research (Panthera tigris corbetti) in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, which has been studied by Khao Nang Rum Wildlife Research Station, found that male tigers have a home range size of approximately 267-300 km2 while females home range size is about 60-70 km2.</p>
